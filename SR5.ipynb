    " Time Complexity: \n",
    "- Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the dataset.\n",
    "- In each iteration, binary search divides the search space in half by comparing the target element with the middle element of the dataset.\n",
    "- As a result, the search space reduces exponentially with each iteration, leading to a logarithmic time complexity.\n",
    "- This efficiency allows binary search to quickly locate the target element, especially in large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Space Complexity: \n",
    "- Binary search has a space complexity of O(1), indicating constant space usage.\n",
    "- The algorithm only requires a few variables to store indices and perform comparisons, regardless of the size of the dataset.\n",
    "- It does not require any additional data structures or memory allocation, making it efficient in terms of space usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficiency:\n",
    "- The O(log n) time complexity of binary search signifies its efficiency, particularly for large datasets.\n",
    "- The logarithmic growth rate means that the time taken to search for an element increases slowly even as the dataset size grows exponentially.\n",
    "- Additionally, the constant space complexity indicates that binary search uses a fixed amount of memory, regardless of the dataset size.\n",
    "- Overall, binary search is highly efficient in terms of both time and space complexity, making it a preferred choice for searching in sorted datasets, especially when dealing with large datasets where performance is crucial."
